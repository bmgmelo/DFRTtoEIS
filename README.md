# DFRTtoEIS

DFRTtoEIS is a standalone MATLAB application software which enables the transformation of DFRT data into a synthetic impedance spectrum, which can then be compared with the original measured impedance data. This work provides a free, fast and easy tool that can facilitate the evaluation of the most accurate DFRT from impedance spectra. Our approach allows the calculation of the individual parameters such as resistance, capacitance and time constants associated with each individual electrochemical process, the extrapolation of the impedance beyond the experimental range, and the reconstruction of the complex impedance and the complex dielectric modulus of each individual electrochemical process.
